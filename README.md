<b>#**About the Project**

This project analyzes traffic accident data collected from the City of Los Angeles Open Data Portal. It includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Geospatial Visualization with GeoPandas
- Time-series trend exploration
- Machine Learning models to predict accident severity (e.g., injury severity or fatality)
  
The goal is to aid urban planning, traffic safety improvement, and predictive resource deployment.

<b>#**Features**

- Analyze accident distribution by:
  - Time (hour, day, month)
  - Location (map-based using GeoPandas)
  - Collision severity and victim counts
- ML model to predict accident **severity**
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
